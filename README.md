# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. As part of this program, companies can pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, in exchange for a mandatory review. The goal of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. This analysis looked at the **Furniture** category.

### Analysis
The analysis looked to answer three questions, as follow, by reviewing the information presented in the table:
- **How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?** Overall, there were 136 Vine reviews, and 18,002 non-Vine reviews.
- **How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?** There were 74 5 star Vine reviews, and 8,472 non-Vine 5 star reviews.
- **What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?** 54.4% of Vine reviews were 5 star reviews, while on 47.1% of non-Vine reviews were for 5 stars.

## Summary
Based on an analysis of the Furniture category, there does seem to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, with more reviews being 5 star for the same products when reviewers were provided the product. However, to further analyze, it would be recommended that different product categories be analyzed to see if this is true across all categories.
